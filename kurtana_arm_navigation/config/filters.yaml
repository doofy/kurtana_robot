    # If discretization is set too high, too many trajectory segments will be
    # generated (the Katana can only process ~16 or so).
    #
    # Discretization does NOT mean time discretization any more!
    # Instead, the new meaning of this parameter is that a new trajectory point
    # is added whenever "max_diff > discretization", where
    # max_diff = the maximum over all joints of the position difference (in rad)
    #            between the previous trajectory point and now
