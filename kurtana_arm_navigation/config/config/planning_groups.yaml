## katana_motor5_wrist_roll_link is included in end_effector group so that
## self-collisions with the arm group are checked (it can physically collide
## with katana_motor1_pan_link).
##
## all links and joints from the URDF are listed here, except for
## - the two fixed joints
## - the link and joint required by the KNI inverse kinematics (katana_base_frame_link)
## - the gripper joints (katana_r_finger_joint, katana_l_finger_joint), because they should not
##   be planned for by the motion planner, but rather be used by the grasping pipeline
