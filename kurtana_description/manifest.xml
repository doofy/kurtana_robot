  <description brief="URDF descriptions of Kurtana robot">

     This package contains URDF descriptions of the Kurtana robot. The complete
     robots are available in the directory "robots/". Each robot consists of
     a base and a top (see those two directories). Usually, a top is made up
     from several parts (see directory "parts/"), such as a laser scanner.
