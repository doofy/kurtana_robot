  <description brief="joint state publisher + muxer to merge Kurtana (Kinect rack) joint states and Katana joint states into joint_states">

    This package contains a joint state publisher and a muxer to merge Kurtana (Kinect rack) joint states and Katana joint states into joint_states. This is necessary because some packages can't cope with multiple publishers on the /joint_states topic.
